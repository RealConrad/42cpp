## Overview
This repository serves as a personal roadmap through the fascinating world of C++, documenting my progress from the very basics to advanced concepts. Starting with fundamental syntax and basic data types, I delve into the core of C++ programming, exploring variables, operators, and control structures to lay a solid foundation. As my journey advances, I tackle more complex topics such as functions, arrays, pointers, and memory management, crucial for understanding the language's depth. The adventure doesn't stop there; I further immerse myself in object-oriented programming, mastering classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Classes, Member functions and other basics (Module00)
### What is a class?
A class is a "blueprint" for creating objects. It defines a new data type. A class contains the following key aspects:
- **Data encapsulation:** A class can contain private, protected and public members. Private are only accessible from within other members of the same class. Protected members are accessible from the class itself and its derived classes. Public members are accessible from anywhere/anyone.
- **Member functions:** These are essentially functions defined inside a class. They can manipulate data members of the class or perform other actions. They are defined/declared inside the class.
- **Constructors/Deconstructors:** These are special members functions that get called when the object is created/destroyed respectively. They are used for initializing/cleaning up objects.
- **Inheritance:** This is a more advanced c++ topic that is basically creating a modified version of an existing class. The new class (derived class) inherits the members of the exisiting class (base class). The derived class can add new members/override existing ones.

### Example
Basic example of how a class would look like:
> NOTE: Due to [42](https://www.42network.org/) rules, we have to create the actual function in a `.cpp` file, but its also valid to write function definitions inside the class itself
```cpp
class MyClass {
    private: // declare anything that should not be accessed outside the class
        std::string myVar1;
        int         myVar2;
    public:
        MyClass(); // constructor
        ~MyClass(); // deconstructor
        void myFunction(); // Member function
};
```
